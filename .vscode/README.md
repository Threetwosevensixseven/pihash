# VSCode

## Build Tasks

VSCode will automatically pick up build tasks from the `.vscode` project subdirectory. `tasks.json` contains the following build tasks:

### make

This tasks builds the `.pihash` dot command. Change variable values in 
[makefile](https://github.com/Threetwosevensixseven/pihash/blob/main/src/dot/makefile) to match your environment.

### make emu

This tasks builds the `.pihash` dot command and launches [CSpect](https://dailly.blogspot.com/). Change variable values in 
[makefile](https://github.com/Threetwosevensixseven/pihash/blob/main/src/dot/makefile) to match your environment.

### make sync
This tasks builds the `.pihash` dot command and launches [NextSync](https://solhsa.com/specnext.html#NEXTSYNC). Change variable values in 
[makefile](https://github.com/Threetwosevensixseven/pihash/blob/main/src/dot/makefile) to match your environment.

[makefile](https://github.com/Threetwosevensixseven/pihash/blob/main/src/dot/makefile) is only tested with Embarcadero MAKE 5.41 for Windows. 
Please let me know if other Windows MAKEs have issues. If you fix it up for linux or mac, please contribute your changes.

## Key Bindings

VSCode key bindings are specified globally for the current user, not by project. To use these bindings, copy `keybindings.json`
to your VSCode user settings. In Windows this is at `%APPDATA%\Code\User\keybindings.json`.

The following key bindings are provided:

### shift+ctrl+F8

Runs the `make emu` build task.

### shift+ctrl+F9

Runs the `make sync` build task.

### shift+ctrl+B

This binding is built into the VSCode defaults, so doesn't depend on the `keybindings.json` file. Runs the `make` build task.
